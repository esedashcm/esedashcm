Each lender has its own set of requirements. Fortunately, every marketplace we have discussed may be an option, even if you have bad credit. Many of the lenders they work with have lenient requirements and are open to extending online loans to all types of borrowers.

When you consider installment loans, however, cash advance loans or direct deposit payday loans are usually much easier to get. The only caveats are that you must be employed and able to repay your loan by the next time you get paid.

If you fail to pay back an online payday loan on time, you’ll be on the hook for sky-high interest charges and fees that can steer you into the cycle of debt. Be cautious with payday lenders unless you’re confident you’ll be able to repay a direct deposit payday loan in time.

If you are not eligible for an installment loan that piques your interest, you may want to improve your credit score. Pay your bills on time, keep your balances low, and only apply for credit when you absolutely need to.
